# The dream

* Can we simplify expense receipt processing for Finance teams?
* Can we use AI to automate the process of sorting through receipts and categorizing them?
* Can we flag items that are not supposed to be expensed? 🍷, 🚬, 🚢
* Can we identify anomalies in the expense reports? A 3km trip costing ₹3000?
* Can we identify duplicate receipts in the expense report?

# The test subject

* Can we identify the items purchased on a receipt?

# The journey - Attempt #3

### Can we get the text in the right order?

* Bounding box to the rescue
* .right[![receipt](receipt-bounding-box.png)]
---

# The journey - Attempt #3

### How do we get the receipt text in the right order?

* Use the bounding boxes to identify horizontally overlapping text based on IOU
* Other mechanisms of clustering (k-means/DBSCAN) didn't work effectively
* .right[![receipt](receipt-bounding-box-expanded.png)]

---

# The journey - Attempt #3

### Feed text to LLM and profit

* Structured response extraction + attempt correction if invalid
* Receipt -> Apple Vision APIs -> IOU Clustering -> LLM -> Output

---

# Make it production grade

* Tests to validate that Apple Vision APIs detect image text correctly on sample images
* Integration test to validate the overall flow
* Half baked tests to validate on a public dataset of 1000 receipt images [CORD](https://github.com/clovaai/cord)
* Use [Langfuse](http://localhost:3000/) for LLMOps
